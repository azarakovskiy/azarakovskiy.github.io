    <h1>
        Hello dear friends!
    </h1>

    <p class="message">
        The time flies and it's only a bit more than two months left till our wedding! ❤️
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        So it is time for an update about dress code, and to answer some of your questions and hopefully give some useful info. 😉
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        I you haven't filled in the questionnaire yet (about food and drink preferences, transport, etc), please do it before 29th July. It is very
        easy and fun, trust us! 😹
    </p>

    <h2>Dress code updates</h2>
    <h3>First day</h3>
    <p class="message">
        The theme of the wedding is travels, therefore any colour would fit and welcome. Some ideas on which colours will be there around:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>summer flowers of different rich colours like pink, blue, green or red</li>
        <li>decorations of gentle colours varying from light blue to pastel like on an old world map</li>
        <li>the house is made of wood: so it gives us a colour of wood</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="message">
        Don't forget about the dancing and activities: you don't want to be stuck in your chair because of a tight dress. 😉
        Also high heels (like very high 👠) are somewhat not really recommended as the ceremony (and also part of the party) will be held on a grass
        greenfield (think of a typical country house).
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        Don't forget to check the weather forecast (it is quite trustful in Latvia). Remember that Latvian night might get chilly-windy-breezy. ☃️
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        Gentlemen, feel free to join the groom wearing <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?t=i&q=happy+socks">happy socks</a>. Think of the traveling theme or
        of the Dutch orange colour. 🧡
    </p>

    <h3>Second day</h3>
    <p class="message">
        Many of us are staying in the party place overnight. Next morning we will have breakfast and the whole day of relax. Bring some comfortable and cozy clothes for a day in the nature (sun, volleyball, guitar, etc).
    </p>

    <h2>
        Presents 🎁
    </h2>

    <p class="message">
        We will be leaving to our honeymoon to Montenegro straight away from Riga with only hand luggage.
        ✈️ Just saying. <br/>But we also like new experiences, so don't throw away your incredible idea if you've got one. ;)
    </p>

    <h2>
        Meeting place and time
    </h2>
    <p class="message">
        Most of you will fit in a bus. <br/>
        We're currently looking for the options. When we know an exact place, we will send you another update. <br/>
        At this moment we can tell it will be Riga city center at around 16:00.
    </p>
    <p class="">
        Those of you who are coming with a car, you might help us by picking up someone. If you can help us, could you please let us know? Paldies! 🚗
    </p>

    <h2>
        What else is there in Latvia and Riga?
    </h2>

    <p class="message">
        We really would like you to also enjoy a pearl of the Baltic states: beautiful Riga since you're going there anyway. 😛
        <br/>
        Here some tips and recommendations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Walk up on the St Peter's tower for a great view of Riga.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a walk in Old Riga (Vecriga) and check Jugend style streets and districts (known by you as art nouveau).
        </li>
        <li>
            For art lovers: check National art museum and Riga Beurs.
        </li>
        <li>
            If it is warm and sunny outside, consider going 30 mins away from Riga to the famous sea resort Jurmala.
            Looong and wide white sand beaches, pine trees forest. 🏖️
            Go to Mayori with a train and walk down to Jomas street towards Dzintari and the beach. Don't forget a swimsuit.
        </li>
        <li>
            You fancy a majestic castle with gardens, done by the same architecture as Versailles in Paris? One or two hours car or bus ride to
            Rundale Palace.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adventurous? Go to Tarzan obstacle adventure park in Sigulda! Just great fun! Please take care, you need your legs.
        </li>
        <li>
            For nature walks: Sigulda & Turaida
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please let us know if you want to walk the most interesting and famous streets of Old Riga and hear some stories. <br/>
        We might be able to walk you around on Sunday evening or Monday, or simply ask friends from Riga who willing to show you the city.
    </p>
