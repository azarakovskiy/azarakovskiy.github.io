        Time flies and only a bit more than two months left till our wedding! ‚ù§Ô∏è
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        So it is time for an update about dress code, and to answer some of your questions and hopefully give some useful info. üòâ
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        If you haven't filled in <a target="_blank" href="/wedding">the questionnaire</a> yet (about food and drink preferences, transport, etc), please do it before 29th July. It is very
        easy and fun, trust us! üòπ
    </p>

    <h2>Dress code updates</h2>
    <h3>First day</h3>
    <p class="message">
        The theme of the wedding is travels, therefore any colour would fit and welcome. Some ideas on which colours will be there around:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>summer flowers of different rich colours like pink, blue, green or red</li>
        <li>decorations of gentle colours varying from light blue to pastel like on an old world map</li>
        <li>the house is made of wood: so it gives us a colour of wood</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="message">
        Don't forget about the dancing and activities: you don't want to be stuck in your chair because of a tight dress. üòâ
        Also high heels (like very high üë†) are somewhat not really recommended as the ceremony (and also part of the party) will be held on a grass
        greenfield (think of a typical country house).
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        Don't forget to check the weather forecast (it is quite trustful in Latvia). Remember that Latvian night might get chilly-windy-breezy. ‚òÉÔ∏è
    </p>
    <p class="message">
        Gentlemen, feel free to join the groom wearing <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?t=i&q=happy+socks">happy socks</a>. Think of the traveling theme or
        of the Dutch orange colour. üß°
    </p>

    <h3>Second day</h3>
    <p class="message">
        Many of us are staying in the party place overnight. Next morning we will have breakfast and the whole day of relax. Bring some comfortable and cozy clothes for a day in the nature (sun, volleyball, guitar, etc).
        <br/>
        Don't forget a swimsuit. :)
    </p>

    <h2>
        Presents üéÅ
    </h2>

    <p class="message">
        We will be leaving to our honeymoon to Montenegro straight away from Riga with only hand luggage.
        ‚úàÔ∏è Just saying. <br/>But we also like new experiences, so don't throw away your incredible idea if you've got one. ;)
    </p>

    <h2>
        Meeting place and time
    </h2>
    <p class="message">
        Most of you will fit in a bus. <br/>
        We're currently looking for the options. When we know an exact place, we will send you another update. <br/>
        At this moment we can tell it will be Riga city center at around 16:00.
    </p>
    <p class="">
        Those of you who are coming with a car, you might help us by picking up someone. If you can help us, could you please let us know? Paldies! üöó
